      - title: Research on Linear Polarization-maintaining NPE Mode-locked Fiber Laser
        link: "#"
        tagline: "I designed and constructed an innovative ultrafast fiber laser utilizing the principle of Nonlinear Polarization
Evolution (NPE) for mode-locking in a Polarization-Maintaining (PM) erbium-doped fiber laser. The
novelty of this work lies in the incorporation of a novel wavelength-division multiplexer (WDM) collimator
integrated device, contributing to a more compact laser architecture. The resultant laser demonstrates
stable output of ultrashort pulses at a repetition rate of 60.9 MHz."

      - title: Research on Transient Dynamics of Dissipative Solitons in Mode-locked Fiber Lasers
        link: "#"
        tagline: "By employing Time-Stretch Dispersion Fourier Transform (TS-DFT) technique, I investigated the dynamic
process of dissipative soliton formation within an anomalous dispersion fiber laser. The construction of
dissipative solitons revealed five distinct transient stages: relaxation oscillations, modulation instability,
spectral broadening, soliton explosion, and stable mode-locking state. Notably, during the soliton explosion
phase, the existence of dissipative rogue waves was discovered. This finding significantly contributes to
comprehending the evolutionary dynamics of dissipative soliton formation within nonlinear dissipative
systems."

      - title: Research on Ultra-compact Femtosecond Fiber Laser Product
        link: "#"
        tagline: "This project aims to transition the research-oriented, dispersion-managed, polarization-maintaining,
erbium-doped femtosecond fiber laser (referred to as the fiber laser) developed within our laboratory
into an industrialized product. The goal is to create a compact, portable, stable, and adaptable
fiber laser product suitable for various complex engineering environments. The fiber laser employs
full-polarization-maintaining fiber with erbium-doped gain medium and features a nine-mirror cavity
structure. By adjusting the lengths of positively and negatively dispersive fibers, the net dispersion
within the cavity can be controlled, yielding pulses with different characteristics. When approaching
near-zero dispersion, the laser generates femtosecond pulses. In an industrial setting, the fiber laser
is pumped by butterfly-packaged laser diodes for energy supply. Mode-locking is achieved by rotating
an internal polarizing waveplate to ensure stable pulse output. During the product design phase, the
precise components of the laser were modeled using Solidworks. These components were fabricated
by a precision machinery factory, followed by assembly and performance testing of the laser to meet
industrial-grade standards. This prototype is capable of generating stable laser pulses at 97 MHz with an impressively
narrow pulse width of only 293 femtoseconds. This product has been included in multiple research
project and grant applications, including the Tsinghua SIGS Concept Verification Project (Fiber Lasers
for Biomedical Imaging) and the Overseas Research Cooperation Fund (Coexistence and Evolution of
Bright and Dark Solitons in Mode-Locked Fiber Lasers)."

      - title: Research on Hybrid Mode-locked Fiber Laser Based on Nonlinear Multimodal Interference
        link: "#"
        tagline: "The project involved the design of a novel semi-polarization-maintaining erbium-doped fiber laser. A
distinctive approach was employed, utilizing a reflective multi-mode interference saturable absorber
(SA) for mode-locking. Within this specially designed SA, linearly polarized light was coupled into
a 15 cm long gradient refractive index multi-mode fiber through polarization-maintaining fiber. The
light was then reflected back into the polarization-maintaining structure via a mirror connected to
a single-mode fiber. The measured modulation depth and saturation peak power were 1.5% and
0.6 watts, respectively. This laser generated mode-locked pulses of 409 femtoseconds at a repetition
rate of 33.3 MHz. Compared to traditional nonlinear polarization evolution (NPE) mode-locking in
non-polarization-maintaining fiber lasers, this laser exhibited superior optical performance metrics,
including spectral bandwidth, pulse duration, and stability."
